# Rust Trash Generator

## What is it?

This program named `Trash Generator` was written in the Rust programming language. It does one simple thing; it generates trash (and it does it's job pretty well). So, if you ever wanted to fill you computer with a 5GB file containing random characters, you now can.

## Installation

1) Install Rust, according to <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>
2) Install Git and clone the repository from the command line using `git clone https://github.com/Oakchris1955/Trash-Generator.git` or by clicking the green button saying `Code` in <https://github.com/Oakchris1955/Trash-Generator.git> clicking `Download ZIP` and unzipping the .zip file
3) Open a terminal and `cd` to the directory you cloned the repository
4) From there, you can use regular cargo command (like `cargo build` or `cargo run --release`) (In my opinion, it is better to build a release build by executing `cargo build --release` and then running the standalone executable)

## Usage

You can just type `EXECUTABLE_PATH.exe --help` to get help about how to use the program, but basically, the arguments define the output filename, the characters within the output file and other various arguments
